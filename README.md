# productivity-helper

Implement a basic todo app with the following features:

- A header at the top saying "My Todo List"
- An input field where the user can type a new todo item
- An "Add" button next to the input to add the new item
- Display a list of todo items below the input 
- For each todo item, show:
  - A checkbox to mark the item as completed
  - The name of the todo item
  - An "Edit" button to edit the item name
  - A "Delete" button to delete the item
- When a todo item is marked as completed, display its name with a strikethrough 
- Store the todo items in state so they persist if the page is refreshed
- Add some basic styling with Chakra UI components to make it look clean and friendly

You can initialize the app with a few example todo items like "Buy groceries", "Walk the dog", "Do laundry", etc.
